# Sliced Pi: A fun Math Game
This is a proof-of-concept for a math game. Most of the frontend is relatively normal. The novelty comes from how variables remain generic and are replaced randomly, thereby defeating sharing (and memorization) of answers, while exposing minimal workload on problemsetting. This method also allows countless variations to be made (e.g. as try-agains or for confirming understanding). The program will automatically put the correct values.
